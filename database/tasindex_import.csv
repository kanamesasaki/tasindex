The spacecraft reached Venus orbit on August 10, 1990, and performed radar mapping and other scientific experiments.","A solar thermal vacuum (STV) test was performed in the on-orbit configuration. The spacecraft overall thermal balance was within about 5°C of predictions in nearly all cases.

After the first solar exposure during cruise operations, the REMs (Rocket Engine Modules) were observed to be about 20°C above expected values. The SINDA thermal math model was upgraded to increase REM detail and prediction capability within <10°C."

This mission included installation of two new Solar Array (SA-3) assemblies. One of the concerns related to SA-3 was a possible mechanical disturbance caused by the quick temperature transition. Therefore, the Disturbance Verification Test (DVT) was conducted at the Large Space Simulator (LSS) chamber in the ESTEC facility, in October 2000. A mathematical thermal model of the test setup was constructed in TSS and SINDA. The thermal predictions were generated for the different test phases and compared to the flight thermal model predictions."
