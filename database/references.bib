ECOSTRESS is a multi-spectral thermal infrared imaging radiometer and its primary mission is to investigate and understand how climate change affects water and carbon usage on Earth. The thermal control subsystem consists of a combination of active and passive components to maintain instrument components within the allowable flight temperature limits. Its focal plane detector is cooled to 65K by a pair of mechanical cryocoolers and a third mechanical cryocooler cools an intermediate cold shield to 130K. The heat dissipation generated by cryocoolers and electronics, is removed through non-planar cold plates and tube-on plate heat exchanger, which are cooled by a circulating fluid loop inside JAXA’s JEM-EF module. The heat collected by the JEM-EF fluid is exchanged with a fluid loop that circulates through radiators located on the exterior of the Space Station. This paper provides an overview of the thermal and cryogenic system design, thermal analysis results and reviews the on-orbit thermal performance.}

  abstract = {Confidence in spacecraft thermal models can be built by tuning their numerous parameters using the results of a thermal-balance test. In such a test, the flight article is placed in a thermal vacuum chamber configured to be as similar to the orbital environment as possible. High power-draw subsystems in the spacecraft are “pulsed” on for a few minutes so that the heat propagation through the system can be measured and conductive values in the model tuned. The thermal model can then be used to make more reliable predictions for the orbital temperatures. The ultimate validation of the model is a comparison of the predictions to the actual on-orbit measured temperatures. This paper describes the procedure, analysis, and results of all of the aforementioned as they apply to the first Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer 3U CubeSat. The first Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer was deployed from the International Space Station on 16 May 2016 and deorbited on 6 May 2017. Many of the tuned-model parameters are applicable to other CubeSats, and could provide a baseline for programs that do not have the resources to dedicate to detailed thermal modeling and testing. A generally good agreement was found to within a few degrees Celsius, between the thermal model and the actual orbital measurements.}

  abstract  = {NASA launched two rovers in June and July of 2003 as a part of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) project. MERA (Spirit) landed on Mars in Gusev Crater at 15 degrees South latitude and 175 degrees East longitude on January 4, 2004 (Squyres, et al., Dec. 2004). MER-B (Opportunity) landed on Mars in Terra Meridiani at 2 degrees South latitude and 354 degrees East longitude on January 25, 2004 (Squyres, et al., Aug. 2004). Both rovers have well exceeded their design lifetime (90 Sols) by more than a factor of 5. Spirit and Opportunity are still healthy and continue to execute their roving science missions at the time of this writing. This paper discusses rover flight thermal performance during the surface missions of both vehicles, covering roughly the time from the MER- landing in late Southern Summer (aereocentric longitude, Ls = 328, Sol 1A) through the Southern Winter solstice (Ls = 90, Sol 255A) to nearly Southern Vernal equinox (Ls = 160 , Sol 398A). This paper describes the MER rover thermal design, its implementation and performance on Mars. The rover surface thermal design performance was better than prelanding predictions. The very successful thermal design allowed a high level of communications immediately after landing without overheating and required a minimal amount of survival heating in the dead of winter. An analytical thermal model developed for the rover was used to predict surface operations performance. A reduced-node version of this model was integrated into the mission planning tool to achieve the proper balance between: 1) a desired science and communications operating profile, 2) the energy available from the power system and 3) requirements to maintain rover hardware within prescribed temperature limits. One of the more challenging thermal problems during surface operations, predicting the performance of actuator and camera electronics warmup heaters, was automated by using heater lookup tables that were periodically updated based on flight telemetry. Specific MER rover thermal flight experiences are discussed in this paper. Lessons learned and suggestions for improving future Mars surface vehicle designs are presented.},

  abstract = {The insertion device for the MUPUS penetrator on Phylae, the lander to be set by the Rosetta mission on the nucleus of Tchurumov-Gerasimenko comet, will have to work in extreme environmental condition. The electronic unit inside the device should be kept at the temperature greater than −55°C (220K) in order to work properly. The expected temperature of the nucleus is of about 130K, while the cosmic background temperature is as low as 3K. Therefore, the electronic box must be heated continuously to balance the heat loss by radiation. The experiments performed in a vacuum-thermal chamber on the flight model of MUPUS has shown that the temperature of the electronics increases, when heated with a power of 1.33W, from 140K by about 120–130K after more than 1h of heating. We present a numerical thermal (FEM) model that gives a very good fit to the measured temperature dependence on time. In the process of fitting, several important thermal parameters of the insertion device have been determined, for instance the emissivity of electronic boards and their specific heat. The numerical models agree qualitatively with the results of simple thermal analysis. The main conclusion concerning performance of the instrument on the comet is that it should safely operate above the lover limit of acceptable temperatures against expected variations of the external temperature in the day-night cycle of the comet.}

  abstract = {HAMSAT is a micro-satellite for providing satellite-based Amateur Radio services to the national as well as the international community of Amateur Radio Operators (HAMs). Micro-satellites (less than 100kg) are becoming increasingly utilized as an economical means of experimentation and research in orbit. The thermal control of micro-satellite presents unique challenges to the thermal engineer since the mass; power and volume available are all very limited. Regardless of these problems and the extreme environments and changing power conditions (internally and externally) of the satellites the subsystems must still be maintained within the specified temperature limits. HAMSAT spins about an axis perpendicular to orbital plane and is placed in 632×621km altitude sun-synchronous orbit. The three new technologies experimented in the spacecraft are lithium-ion batteries, Bus Management Unit and multi junction gallium arsenide solar cells in LEO orbit. A purely passive thermal control system without heaters is used to control the temperature of the spacecraft. Thermal design and on-orbit temperature characteristics are presented and discussed. The spacecraft has completed one year of operation on orbit. The on orbit thermal performance of the spacecraft is good and matches well with the prediction. Impact of variation in thermal parameters on temperature is discussed.}

  abstract = {This paper describes thermal design of the radiation detector (RD) for the ChubuSat-2 with the use of high-thermal-conductive materials. ChubuSat-2 satellite is a 50-kg-class micro-satellite joint development with Nagoya University and aerospace companies. The main mission equipment of ChubuSat-2 is a RD to observe neutrons and gamma rays. However, the thermal design of the RD encounters a serious problem, such as no heater for RD and electric circuit alignment constrain. To solve this issue, the RD needs a new thermal design and thermal control for successful space missions. This paper proposes high-thermal-conductive graphite sheets to be used as a flexible radiator fin for the RD. Before the fabrication of the device, the optimal thickness and surface area for the flexible radiator fin were determined by thermal analysis. Consequently, the surface area of flexible radiator fin was determined to be 8.6×104mm2. To verify the effects of the flexible radiator fin, we constructed a verification model and analyzed the temperature distributions in the RD. Also, the thermal vacuum test was performed using a thermal vacuum chamber, which was evacuated at a pressure of around 10−4Pa, and its internal temperature was cooled at −80°C by using a refrigerant. As a result, it has been demonstrated that the flexible radiator fin is effective. And the thermal vacuum test results are presented good correlation with the analysis results.}

The performance of SCD is vulnerable to temperature. We analyzed the thermal condition of LE at different satellite working attitudes with the Finite Element Method (FEM). It is shown that the angle between the sunlight and the normal line of the barrier should be less than 26°, to keep the SCD detectors working in the required temperature range, i.e. −40 °C to −80 °C. We find that the performance of LE is very stable in this temperature range, with a typical energy resolution of 160 eV at 5.9 keV.}

  abstract  = {ZACube-2 is 3-Unit nanosatellite operating in low earth orbit. As for many electronic devices, the temperature within the satellite is an important factor for the function of some components. Following the assumption that thermal behavior can be modelled by software, ZACube-2 needs to be modelled, simplified, meshed and analysed in NX 12, a computer aided design and simulation software. To do so required an accurate but simple finite element model of the printed circuit boards (PCBs) for the various satellite subsystems. Specific material properties and finite element methods for modelling PCBs were found. These properties and methods were found by simulating the PCB behavior under thermal loading and comparing to that of tested specimens. The results showed an accuracy between the simulated and tested results of within 3{\%}. The PCBs are used for almost all electronic hardware. They are complex and the approach used introduces a way of modelling them in a simplified but accurate method and using the findings for thermal modelling. These methods and procedures can be used in various industries that have electronics that are at the risk of overheating to improve the designing process and the efficiency of the product.},

  abstract = {The evaluation of space optical instruments under thermo-elastic loads is a complex and multidisciplinary process that requires integrating thermal, structural, and optical disciplines. This thorough analysis often requires substantial resources, leading small satellite projects to exclude it from their schedules. However, even though the instrument discussed in this paper is compact, its complex design and stringent dimensional stability requirements demand a comprehensive evaluation of its performance under thermal loads. The hyperspectral camera, which comprises 18 lenses, a grating, a slit, and a detector, is especially vulnerable to thermo-elastic distortions, as the deformation of even a single lens could significantly impact its performance. In this paper, we present the experimental validation of the STOP analysis applied to the HYPerspectral Small satellite for ocean Observation (HYPSO) Hypespectral Imager (HSI) model. Both the HSI Structural Thermal Optical Performance (STOP) numerical model and the HSI engineering model were subjected to identical thermal conditions in the simulations and in a Thermal and Vacuum Chamber (TVAC), and subsequently the optical results derived from simulations and the test campaign compared. To characterize the thermal field, an infrared camera and thermocouples were used. Moreover, to assess the thermal performance of the HSI, we measured the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the main peaks in the intensity-wavelength spectra when the hyperspectral camera targeted a known spectral lamp. After individually calibrating the STOP models so that the FWHM and index of the intensity peaks are in close alignment with the experimentally measured FWHM and index, the lenses most sensitive for displacements were characterized.}

  abstract = {CubeSats have revolutionized the space industry in the past two decades. Its successor, the PocketQube class seems to be a lower size limit for a satellite which can operate continuously and can be received by radio amateur equipment. The present paper discusses the simulation of the thermal environment of the SMOG-1 PocketQube satellite at low Earth orbit by both thermal network and finite element models. The major findings of the analyses are the following. Even a single node per printed circuit board model can provide adequate information about the thermal behavior without tuning the physical parameters. By applying a finite element model with few magnitudes more nodes, the predicted inner temperature increased as the losses were reduced in the radiation-dominant environment compared to the thermal network model. Therefore, this latter method provides a more conservative temperature estimation. The most sensitive component of small-sized satellites is the battery which remains in the desired positive temperature regime even in this satellite class according to the finite element model. However, the thermal network model predicted a restricted battery charging protocol to ∼50% of the lit duration. Nevertheless, this condition still results in a positive energy balance by a factor of 1.5.}

  abstract = {This study examines the thermal management strategies employed by AlAinSat-1 to endure extreme space conditions. It provides an in-depth analysis of the satellite’s thermal behavior through numerical simulations and validates its ability to function in space using experimental testing. AlAinSat-1 is a nanosatellite designed in the shape of a cube, equipped with an Earth observation payload. The thermal analysis was performed using Siemens NX software, following a structured process that included idealization, meshing, and the application of boundary conditions. Simulations were conducted to evaluate the CubeSat’s performance in the worst-case hot and cold scenarios, predicting the temperature range required for mission success. Simulation results confirm that AlAinSat-1 can withstand extreme space conditions, with all components remaining within their operational temperature ranges. To validate these findings, bakeout and thermal vacuum cycling tests were performed using a small Thermal Vacuum Chamber (TVAC). The bakeout test, conducted at 50 °C for five hours, aimed to eliminate volatile contaminants from the CubeSat’s sensitive components, reducing the risk of outgassing. This test achieved a 0.1 % total mass loss, indicating success. The thermal vacuum cycling test involved four cycles ranging from −20 °C to + 50 °C, with a dwell time of one hour per cycle. These tests confirmed the operational temperature range of the CubeSat’s components. The experimental results were consistent with the simulations, demonstrating that all components of AlAinSat-1 functioned effectively within their designated temperature limits. This alignment validates the thermal management approach and ensures the CubeSat’s readiness for space deployment.}

This mission aims at demonstrating the capabilities of nano-satellites, and in particular those based in the 1-Unit CubeSat standard, for challenging Earth Observation (EO) using Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) and L-band microwave radiometry, as well as for Automatic Identification Systems (AIS). The following study presents the results of the thermal analysis carried out for this mission, evaluating different scenarios, including the most critical cases at both high and low temperatures. The results consider different albedos and orbital parameters in order to establish the optimal temperatures to achieve the best mission performance within the nominal temperatures, and in all operational modes of the satellite. Simulation results are included considering the thermal performance of other materials, such as Kapton, as well as the redesign of the optical properties of the satellite’s solar panels. The correlation with the thermal model and the TVAC test campaign was conducted at the ESA ESEC-GALAXIA facilities in Belgium.},
