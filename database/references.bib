ECOSTRESS is a multi-spectral thermal infrared imaging radiometer and its primary mission is to investigate and understand how climate change affects water and carbon usage on Earth. The thermal control subsystem consists of a combination of active and passive components to maintain instrument components within the allowable flight temperature limits. Its focal plane detector is cooled to 65K by a pair of mechanical cryocoolers and a third mechanical cryocooler cools an intermediate cold shield to 130K. The heat dissipation generated by cryocoolers and electronics, is removed through non-planar cold plates and tube-on plate heat exchanger, which are cooled by a circulating fluid loop inside JAXA’s JEM-EF module. The heat collected by the JEM-EF fluid is exchanged with a fluid loop that circulates through radiators located on the exterior of the Space Station. This paper provides an overview of the thermal and cryogenic system design, thermal analysis results and reviews the on-orbit thermal performance.}

  abstract = {Confidence in spacecraft thermal models can be built by tuning their numerous parameters using the results of a thermal-balance test. In such a test, the flight article is placed in a thermal vacuum chamber configured to be as similar to the orbital environment as possible. High power-draw subsystems in the spacecraft are “pulsed” on for a few minutes so that the heat propagation through the system can be measured and conductive values in the model tuned. The thermal model can then be used to make more reliable predictions for the orbital temperatures. The ultimate validation of the model is a comparison of the predictions to the actual on-orbit measured temperatures. This paper describes the procedure, analysis, and results of all of the aforementioned as they apply to the first Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer 3U CubeSat. The first Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer was deployed from the International Space Station on 16 May 2016 and deorbited on 6 May 2017. Many of the tuned-model parameters are applicable to other CubeSats, and could provide a baseline for programs that do not have the resources to dedicate to detailed thermal modeling and testing. A generally good agreement was found to within a few degrees Celsius, between the thermal model and the actual orbital measurements.}

  abstract  = {NASA launched two rovers in June and July of 2003 as a part of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) project. MERA (Spirit) landed on Mars in Gusev Crater at 15 degrees South latitude and 175 degrees East longitude on January 4, 2004 (Squyres, et al., Dec. 2004). MER-B (Opportunity) landed on Mars in Terra Meridiani at 2 degrees South latitude and 354 degrees East longitude on January 25, 2004 (Squyres, et al., Aug. 2004). Both rovers have well exceeded their design lifetime (90 Sols) by more than a factor of 5. Spirit and Opportunity are still healthy and continue to execute their roving science missions at the time of this writing. This paper discusses rover flight thermal performance during the surface missions of both vehicles, covering roughly the time from the MER- landing in late Southern Summer (aereocentric longitude, Ls = 328, Sol 1A) through the Southern Winter solstice (Ls = 90, Sol 255A) to nearly Southern Vernal equinox (Ls = 160 , Sol 398A). This paper describes the MER rover thermal design, its implementation and performance on Mars. The rover surface thermal design performance was better than prelanding predictions. The very successful thermal design allowed a high level of communications immediately after landing without overheating and required a minimal amount of survival heating in the dead of winter. An analytical thermal model developed for the rover was used to predict surface operations performance. A reduced-node version of this model was integrated into the mission planning tool to achieve the proper balance between: 1) a desired science and communications operating profile, 2) the energy available from the power system and 3) requirements to maintain rover hardware within prescribed temperature limits. One of the more challenging thermal problems during surface operations, predicting the performance of actuator and camera electronics warmup heaters, was automated by using heater lookup tables that were periodically updated based on flight telemetry. Specific MER rover thermal flight experiences are discussed in this paper. Lessons learned and suggestions for improving future Mars surface vehicle designs are presented.},

  abstract = {The insertion device for the MUPUS penetrator on Phylae, the lander to be set by the Rosetta mission on the nucleus of Tchurumov-Gerasimenko comet, will have to work in extreme environmental condition. The electronic unit inside the device should be kept at the temperature greater than −55°C (220K) in order to work properly. The expected temperature of the nucleus is of about 130K, while the cosmic background temperature is as low as 3K. Therefore, the electronic box must be heated continuously to balance the heat loss by radiation. The experiments performed in a vacuum-thermal chamber on the flight model of MUPUS has shown that the temperature of the electronics increases, when heated with a power of 1.33W, from 140K by about 120–130K after more than 1h of heating. We present a numerical thermal (FEM) model that gives a very good fit to the measured temperature dependence on time. In the process of fitting, several important thermal parameters of the insertion device have been determined, for instance the emissivity of electronic boards and their specific heat. The numerical models agree qualitatively with the results of simple thermal analysis. The main conclusion concerning performance of the instrument on the comet is that it should safely operate above the lover limit of acceptable temperatures against expected variations of the external temperature in the day-night cycle of the comet.}

  abstract = {HAMSAT is a micro-satellite for providing satellite-based Amateur Radio services to the national as well as the international community of Amateur Radio Operators (HAMs). Micro-satellites (less than 100kg) are becoming increasingly utilized as an economical means of experimentation and research in orbit. The thermal control of micro-satellite presents unique challenges to the thermal engineer since the mass; power and volume available are all very limited. Regardless of these problems and the extreme environments and changing power conditions (internally and externally) of the satellites the subsystems must still be maintained within the specified temperature limits. HAMSAT spins about an axis perpendicular to orbital plane and is placed in 632×621km altitude sun-synchronous orbit. The three new technologies experimented in the spacecraft are lithium-ion batteries, Bus Management Unit and multi junction gallium arsenide solar cells in LEO orbit. A purely passive thermal control system without heaters is used to control the temperature of the spacecraft. Thermal design and on-orbit temperature characteristics are presented and discussed. The spacecraft has completed one year of operation on orbit. The on orbit thermal performance of the spacecraft is good and matches well with the prediction. Impact of variation in thermal parameters on temperature is discussed.}
